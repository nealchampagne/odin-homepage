# Odin Homepage

## Description
This is my implementation of the Hompage project from the Advanced HTML and CSS course of the Odin Project's Full-Stack Javascript Curriculum.

First, I built out the HTML skeleton. Next, I fleshed out the CSS from top-to-bottom with a mobile-first design approach. When that was finished, I used a media query to build in the tablet styling, and then finally desktop styling.

Next, I went through all of my images, converting them to webp to save on size. Then,I provided the flexibly-sized portrait image with several different-sized versions so the browser could choose the most efficient size for the current viewport. Last, I used the picture element to handle some light art direction for the candid photo in the contact section, providing a closer-cropped image for smaller devices.

This was also my first time working extensively with accessibility tools. I made sure to use all semantic HTML elements where appropriate except for containers. I used a screen reader to work through the page and ensure that all images and links were navigable by visually-impared users. I also made sure all links were reachable by tabbing.
